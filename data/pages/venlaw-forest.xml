&lt;p&gt;GM Land soltions took on the job, initially 2200 Meters of road to do, but then on the manager seeing the job, it was extended by another 800 Meters as they were so pleased with the finished result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please see photos below.&amp;nbsp; The 7.5 Ton digger seen in the photo, recently purchased by Gavin, was perfect for this size of job.&lt;/p&gt;
