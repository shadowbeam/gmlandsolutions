	Our customer had just recently had a large extention project completed on their house and were looking for a new look to their gardes&lt;br /&gt;
	We got together to discuss their plans and come up with some intial ideas, the aim was to create a garden that provided a flat area for entertaiing and for the kids to play in, with a small circualar seating area feature, a path and steps... all to try and fit in with the original features of the property as much as possible using materials that will be more durable and less likley to wear and discolour ovr time unlike some manufactured alternatives might do.&lt;br /&gt;
	Our soloution was to base all the stonework on real, natural sandstone (paving is natural sandstone), gravel from a local quarry and new turf for the lawn area.&lt;/p&gt;
